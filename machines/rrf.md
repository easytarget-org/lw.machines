RepRapFirmware runs on 32 bit microprocessors such as the Atmel/Microchip SAM3X8E, SAM4E8E, SAM4S8C and SAME70Q20 processors found in Duet electronics. There is also a port for boards using LPC1768/1769 processors, and a port for STM processors is under way. It supports 3D printers, CNC machines, laser cutters and engravers.
