### Generic Machine

If you cant find your machine, or one similar in the main list, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software" target="_blank">vanilla</a> profile for you to start out with.

This will work well for most machines once you have gone through the LaserWeb settings adjusting them as necessary. Pay particular attention to GCode start and stop scripts, these are where most firmware differences crop up.

For further help and advice on setting up LaserWeb for use with your machine please check out the <a href="https://github.com/LaserWeb/LaserWeb4/wiki" target="_blank">Wiki</a> and <a href="https://forum.makerforums.info/c/laserweb-cncweb" target="_blank">forums</a>.
